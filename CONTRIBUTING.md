# Contributing

This is a community maintained chart that is not directly affiliated with the official Pixelfed project, but we are always happy to recieve Issues and Pull Requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Please remember to bump the [`version` in `Chart.yaml`](https://github.com/small-hack/pixelfed-chart/blob/main/charts/pixelfed/Chart.yaml#L18).
2. If you don't allow our GitHub Actions Workflows to run on your personal account, please run [`helm-docs`](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) locally before pushing up, that way the docs stay up to date :)

## Issues

Please include the version of the chart you have an feature request or bug report for as well as your values.yaml at the time. If this is about an error, please also include the error and where you found the error (pod log etc).
